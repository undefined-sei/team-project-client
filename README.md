This app is a chatroom app where users can sign in and have access to a chatroom that they create messages sent in real time to other users logged in. Users can also edit and delete their own messages, and have no fear of other users deleting their messages

We as a group began this project with a clear idea of what our MVP product should be. We lined out our user stories and worked on a wirefram alongside our ERD's. We wanted to avoid as many conflicts as a group, so we elected Alex our Scrum leader and Josh as our Front End leader. Alex was to be the main Back End leader.

As we began this project we seperated out who would work on which folder and attempted to follow this structure throughout the project. Ismael was to create our authentication, Rick was to work on message CRUD, Josh was to work on html and app.js, and Alex was working on creating our backend. As we all completed our work we checked our work and continued to check in with our progress. We moved alonged to our next parts in the project. Ismael was to work on design, Rick was to start work on handlebars, Josh was to help as needed and keep these tasks on track while attempting tests, and Alex was to work on Sockets. As this played out we managed to complete our MVP product

Overall we are pleased with the progress this project has. We would like to implement a few features, including a way for users to create chatrooms, as well as avatars for themselves.
